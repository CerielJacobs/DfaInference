		Abbdingo One: DFA Learing Competition

			       DATASETS

The files train.?.gz are sample strings labeled by the sixteen
languages in the contest.  You should use them to infer the languages.
You can test your answers using test.?.gz, which are strings you can
classify and then test via the oracle.

Data sets A, B, C, and D are just for practice.

The problem data sets (1, 2, 3, R, 4, 5, 6, S, 7, 8, 9, and T) vary in
both target DFA size and the relative amount of data provided.

The first line of each file tells how many strings it contains, and
how many symbols are in the input alphabet (always 2 for this
competition).  Each succeeding line specifies one string.  The first
number on the line is the label for the string (or -1 if the file is
for testing).  The second number is the length of the string.  The
remaining numbers are the symbols comprising the string.

You must have an error rate on the test set of 1% or less to solve
that problem.  The only way to tell for sure if you have satisfied
this criterion is to ask the Abbadingo Oracle.

Good luck, and may the best algorithm win!
