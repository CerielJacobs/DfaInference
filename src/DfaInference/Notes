on MDL complexity:
- when merging states, the DFA measure decreases, and the sample measure
  increases. Now suppose that the current best DFA has score BS and a proposed
  DFA has DFA measure D and sample measure S. Then, if S >= BS, the proposed
  DFA can never lead to an improvement of the current best DFA, because the
  sample measure will only increase when merging states.
  
on weights:
- maybe administer them per link, rather than per state?
